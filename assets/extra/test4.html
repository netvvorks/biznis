  <!-- 
    <p>Welcome to 1grid. Here we find you trustworthy workers for your budget.</p>
<p>Categories: Landscaping, tiles, installation, hvac, painter, roofer, plumber, electrician, etc.</p>
<p>For each category we will have workers we personally can vouch for and trust, along with their profile and pricing. Our goal is to keep it transparent</p>
<p>To make both of your lvies easier we may ask for some dimensions or details before giving you contact to the workers</p>
<p>We will also include locations.</p>
<p> What I think is the best way to make this work is having a landing page, where a drop down menu appears showing all the categories and the locations. Each worker will have their own location where they mainly operate and where they're willing to travel from</p>
<p> There is also a glossary? TO show what each tradde means and does. If you are unsure what trade you need you can use the search function.
    It'll show you the most likely trade regarding your concern. 
</p>
<p>Add a SEARCH function as well</p>
